-A relatively simple game, guess the randomly generated number between 1 and 100. 
-now with data validation!
-As the computer insults and curses at you when you are wrong (and even when you're right for that matter), it's pretty NSFW, 
so you've been warned.

-created for my java dev class at Cincy CodeIT.
